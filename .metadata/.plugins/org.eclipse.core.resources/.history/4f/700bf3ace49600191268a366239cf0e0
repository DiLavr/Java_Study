/**
 * Finding Prime Number
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that 
cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. 
A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1,
involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3)
that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in number theory because of the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either
a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.r
