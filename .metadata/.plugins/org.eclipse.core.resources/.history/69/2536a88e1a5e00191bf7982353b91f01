/*
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter two characters as a 
 * single input and displays the major and status represented in the characters. 
 * It is important that the input is a single input, not two separate inputs - 
 * refer to the samples given below. The first character indicates the major and 
 * the second is number character 1, 2, 3, or 4, 
 * which indicates whether a student is a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior.
 * 
 * M: Mathematics
C: 	
I: Information Technology
SAMPLE RUN 1:
Enter two characters: M1
Mathematics Freshman
SAMPLE RUN 2:
Enter two characters: C3
Computer Science Junior
SAMPLE RUN 3:
Enter two characters: T3
Invalid Input
